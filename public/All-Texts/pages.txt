ABOUT PAGE:

- You can't put a limit on the love for your craft!

- Hey, I'm SntSwetlana, and I'm not just a web developer who loves building functional and user-friendly digital apps. With years of experience across different areas of the digital industry, I'm always on the lookout for new and innovative ways to bring interesting ideas to life.

- I believe that modern technology is the best tool we could have received to bring to life ideas that have been brewing for years. Today, it is more than just a beautiful design, it is a fast solution to many problems and the creation of an intuitive, pleasant interface that allows us to solve tasks of any importance.

- Whether I'm working on a website, a mobile application, or any other digital product, I bring my dedication to quality development and user-centered thinking to every project I work on.

EXPERIENCE: 

Software Developer @Voronezh Research Institute of Communications
Summer 1999-2012| Voronezh, Russian Federation.
Worked in a team responsible for the development of new commercial satellite band hardware and software systems, including the development of a new user interface and commercial band data analysis.

Software Developer @Moscow Research and production company
Summer 2007-2020 | Moscow, Russian Federation.
Participated in the development of the architecture and interface of software complexes for the accounting and fixing of changes in the loading of commercial frequency bands across different ranges, as well as for fixing changes in the topology of registered networks.

Software Developer @Moscow Astronomical Science Center
2012-Present | Moscow, Russian Federation
As an interface programmer, I was responsible for developing interfaces for software complexes that take into account and record changes in the loading of commercial frequency bands and network topology. I created various user interface options, selected appropriate design choices, and developed corresponding functional capabilities based on user role models. Intuitively understandable and easy-to-use interfaces allowed for significant time savings in performing tasks. I utilized various data visualization tools such as diagrams, waterfalls, graphics, and tabular representations to help users quickly assess the state of the system.
I participated in integrating notification functions into the interface so that users could quickly receive notifications about system changes and respond to them promptly.
As an interface programmer, it was always important for me to provide a clear and effective way for users to interact with software complexes for tracking and fixing changes in the loading of commercial frequency bands and network topology.
